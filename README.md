# React Testing Crash Course

A base practice using testing library and cypress.

Based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVNjsIto9xM) but with use of typescript.

The actually files coded were:
- [TransactionCreateStepTwo.test.tsx](src/components/TransactionCreateStepTwo.test.tsx) as unit / integration
- [payment_spec.ts](cypress/integration/payment_spec.ts) as integration test
